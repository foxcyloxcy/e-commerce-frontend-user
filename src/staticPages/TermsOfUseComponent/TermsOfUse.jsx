                            Our platform facilitates the buying and selling of items between individuals, albeit Reloved receives payment and then will process it to the seller. While we make every effort to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our platform, we cannot guarantee the quality or authenticity of the items listed for sale. Therefore, it is important that buyers exercise due diligence and thoroughly review the item description and seller feedback before making a purchase.

                        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                            As a seller on our platform, you are responsible for accurately describing your item and its condition, as well as ensuring that you have the right to sell the item. You are also responsible for ensuring accurate shipping information and location collection. You are responsible to ensure the item is collected within agreed timeframes of the buyer through an agreed delivery method as agreed with the buyer. When receiving payment from the buyer this will be listed as ‘mamo pay’ on your bank statement as this was processed through reloved rather than directly from the buyer.

As the buyer, it is your responsibility for arranging the collection of the item, whether it be through personal collection or arranging for a courier to deliver to your address. The buyer is responsible for paying the service platform fee.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. Please ensure that you check the applicable Terms every time you use our Platform so that you understand which Terms apply.

                            Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific services (and such services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant service, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall control for that specific service.

If we make material changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such changes, such as by providing notice through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service.
